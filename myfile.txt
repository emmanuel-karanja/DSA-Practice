What would I prefer to do if I was this free? Interesting that I’d still write code. And I’d pursue the possibility of making movies. I have some work already written. I know I’d never go back to drinking. 

I am going into the Google thing with confidence and faith. I only need to cover a few things and I am finding myself fixated on the graph cycle detection stuff and topological sort.

But given the option of spending some money belonging to a client and going through the shit, I’ll spend the client’s money.
